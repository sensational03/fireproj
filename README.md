CNN is still in development. You can refer the MLmodelcreator.py file for the code. It's not possible to upload the whole image dataset due to its extremely large size. So, I have provided sceenshots of the output of CNN and its analysis.

To test RandomForrest and K-Nearest Neighbor, run the tester.py file with your input image.
